# Title {#title}

(Put your working title here)

## Hook {#hook}

(Put your tagline here or your hook. If you summed up the game into one or two sentences at most, that is what you would put here.)

# Genre {#genre}

(Keep it specific to what your core game is. Avoid adding genres just because they look like a good marketing tag on say steam. If your game only shares a single element with another genre it would be better to avoid adding that genre as a tag. For example, If you have a drink mechanic but no other crossover features with a survival game you would actually harm the game by putting survival as a genre)

# Platform {#platform}

(Where are you planning to release, make note of any particular reason why. For instance if you want the Epic Store because of it’s ability to handle any log in in a single account. Or perhaps you want to target a specific VR Hardware)

# Target Audience {#target-audience}

(Description of who your audience is.   
Define Key Demographics such as age, gender, location, economic status.   
Define behaviors such as interests and hobbies, values and motivations, gaming habits, spending habits.   
Make a profile of a person that fits a couple personas.   
Tip\! Make an investor persona)

# Core Gameplay Loop {#core-gameplay-loop}

(Define the core game loop, make sure it is clear how players interact with it and how it feeds back into itself, if at all)

# Setting {#setting}

(Briefly describe the world that the game takes place in)

# Story {#story}

(Outline the general story of the game, who the key characters are, and what the major moments are)

# Unique Selling Points {#unique-selling-points}

(Specifically how your game set itself apart from the rest of its peers in the market.   
For the game Green Hell, they added a mechanic that allowed the player to check and rotate the characters limbs and body for injuries and treat them.  
In the game The Forest, they added a crafting mechanic where the player got a visual representation of their inventory and crafting with 3d models from their inventory.   
In the game No Man’s Sky each world is procedurally generated and unique, they also simulated fluid transition from space to planet and made it feel great)

# Visual Style {#visual-style}

(Get some concept art, placeholder images, reference images, and or make mood boards and photo bash concepts to give some visual reference to what the game should look like.  
Tip: you can do the same thing with audio, playing a sound track over a presentation for instance.)

# Inspirations {#inspirations}

(Who or what is inspiring your game concept, summarizes why)

# Development team {#development-team}

(Who is working on your game, what are they great at? Who do you still need to work on your game? Why do you need them?  
Tip: if you have advisors, mentors, or people you get feedback from etc… you can ask to list them as such. Starting out you don’t have a name, but if you have a person that has been in the industry for a while it will look good to potential investors as it shows you are seeking valid expertise)
